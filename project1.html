<h1>Fallout 76 Vendor Automation Project</h1>

  <!-- Introduction Section -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This project, which I created recently (March 2025) in my spare time, automates the process of managing and pricing vendor-sellable plans in Fallout 76, a game which I play regularly on Xbox. Many players (myself included) keep large inventories of plans, but manually checking prices and tracking them is tedious and time-consuming. I created this tool to streamline that process by combining image recognition, data scraping, and simple automation into one console-based application. The app would be potentially useful for bulk sellers who frequently update their in-game vendor stock and want consistent, up-to-date pricing suggestions. As of yet, I haven't distributed it online, nor updated it to be compatible with any computer outside of my own, but the possibility to do so is always there. Then again, I question whether many players would find as much utility in this tool as I have…

  <!-- How It Works Section -->
<h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>
    The program begins when the user initiates an inventory capture from the menu.
    Using the Xbox app’s remote play feature, a screenshot of the in-game inventory 
    is taken on the PC. AutoHotkey macros are used to override the default screenshot save 
    location so that the app can access the file immediately. Before OCR (Optical Character Recognition) 
    begins, the screenshot is cropped, brightened, and contrast-enhanced using the 
    <a href="https://sixlabors.com/products/imagesharp/" target="_blank">SixLabors.ImageSharp</a> 
    library to improve text recognition accuracy. Then, Tesseract OCR extracts text from the processed image. 
    Each recognized plan name is compared against a local pricing database created by scraping data from the 
    <a href="https://fed76.info/plans" target="_blank">FED76 Plan Database</a>. Finally, the results — including 
    plan names, price ranges, and suggested prices — are displayed in a clear tabular format.
